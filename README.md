# qfmoney-csv-export
A dirt-simple-hacky Chrome extension to export transation data of Qantas Premier credit cards
into CSV format suitable for YNAB.

This extension works by parsing the DOM of transaction page, so it only exports what's visible
on the page.

CSV file is generated locally within the extension.
